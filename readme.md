Myleage

A telnet server for keeping track of simple, integer dollar expenses and mileage.

Capabilities include an accounts/serial engine complete with password-based login, and management of existing data. 


Once compiled, you will need to create directories \Accounts, \Serials, and \Data to give the server places to store data.

To add a serial, just place a file with the serial name in the \Serials folder; once used to register the account the serial will be deleted.
